<h1>My React Portfolio</h1>
This repository holds the code for my personal website. THe purpose of the website is to be used as a demonstration and repo of my capabilites as a web developer. It was built using React and Vite, and is powered by the animation framework FramerMotion. It contains the basics of a website such as a navigation, hero page, interactive elements, and a footer. Each project module sends the user to a repository in my GitHub.
